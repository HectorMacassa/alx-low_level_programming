0x08-recursion

Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem. In other words, a recursive function is a function that repeats its own algorithm in a smaller or simpler way until it reaches a base case, at which point it returns a value without making a recursive call. Recursion is a powerful and elegant way to solve problems that have a recursive or self-referential structure.
